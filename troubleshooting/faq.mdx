### What's the difference between Squares and other content types?

### Can I create content without associating it with a Square?
All content in BeatSquares must be associated with at least one Square for organizational purposes. You can create a general "Miscellaneous" Square for content that doesn't fit into specific projects.

### How do I edit content after I've published it?
Click on any content item in your Square to access the editing interface. Make your changes and save or republish as needed.
