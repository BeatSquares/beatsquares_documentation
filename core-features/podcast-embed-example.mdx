## How to Implement This

To add a similar player to your website, you can use either the script or iframe method:

### Method 1: Script Embed (Recommended)

```html
<script 
  class="podigee-podcast-player" 
  src="https://player.podigee-cdn.net/podcast-player/javascripts/podigee-podcast-player.js" 
  data-configuration="https://[YOUR-PODCAST-SLUG].podigee.io/embed?context=external">
</script>
```

This method provides the most flexibility and advanced features.

### Method 2: iFrame Embed

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://[YOUR-PODCAST-SLUG].podigee.io/embed?context=external" 
  width="100%" 
  height="400" 
  frameborder="0" 
  scrolling="no">
</iframe>
```

This method works better with content management systems and static site generators.

### Steps to Get Your Embed Code

1. Go to your BeatSquares podcast settings
2. Look for the **Distribution** or **Embed** section
3. Find your Podigee configuration URL
4. Replace `[YOUR-PODCAST-SLUG]` with your podcast's unique identifier
