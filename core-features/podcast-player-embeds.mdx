- **Width**: Responsive (100%)
- **Features**: Playback controls, episode information

### Getting the Embed Code

1. Navigate to your podcast in the [BeatSquares Dashboard](https://app.beatsquares.com/)
2. Open the episode you want to embed
3. Copy your podcast's unique ID from the URL or episode settings
4. Use the embed code template below

### Embed Code Template

```html
<iframe
  src="https://app.beatsquares.com/podcasts/[YOUR-PODCAST-ID]/stream/full"
  width="100%"
  height="226px"
  frameBorder="0"
  allowFullScreen>
</iframe>
```

### Example

```html
<iframe
  src="https://app.beatsquares.com/podcasts/6878c2cbea398ec14ba1a1f1/stream/full"
  width="100%"
  height="226px"
  frameBorder="0"
  allowFullScreen>
</iframe>
```

### Customization Options

#### Fixed Width
For specific layouts, set a fixed width instead of 100%:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://app.beatsquares.com/podcasts/[YOUR-PODCAST-ID]/stream/full"
  width="600px"
  height="226px"
  frameBorder="0"
  allowFullScreen>
</iframe>
```

#### Responsive Container
Wrap the iframe in a container for better control:

```html
<div class="podcast-embed-container">
  <iframe
    src="https://app.beatsquares.com/podcasts/[YOUR-PODCAST-ID]/stream/full"
    width="100%"
    height="226px"
    frameBorder="0"
    allowFullScreen>
  </iframe>
</div>
```

Style with CSS:

```css
.podcast-embed-container {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 2rem auto;
  padding: 1rem;
  background: #f5f5f5;
  border-radius: 8px;
}
```

## Option 2: Podigee Integration

### Setting Up Podigee Integration

#### Step 1: Connect Your BeatSquares Account

3. Enable **Podigee Integration**
4. Follow the authorization flow to connect your accounts

#### Step 2: Publish to Podigee

1. Log in to your Podigee account
2. Navigate to your podcast dashboard
3. Click on **Embed** or **Share**
4. Choose between Script or iFrame embed method
5. Copy the generated embed code

### Embed Methods

Podigee offers two embedding methods:

#### Method 1: Full Embed Code (Script) - Recommended

This method provides the most flexibility and advanced features. It dynamically loads the player with full functionality.

```html
<script 
  class="podigee-podcast-player" 
  src="https://player.podigee-cdn.net/podcast-player/javascripts/podigee-podcast-player.js" 
  data-configuration="https://[YOUR-PODCAST-SLUG].podigee.io/embed?context=external">
</script>
```

**Example:**
```html
<script 
  class="podigee-podcast-player" 
  src="https://player.podigee-cdn.net/podcast-player/javascripts/podigee-podcast-player.js" 
  data-configuration="https://beatsquares-test-podcast.podigee.io/embed?context=external">
</script>
```

**Best for:**
- Custom websites with full HTML/JavaScript control
- WordPress sites with custom theme access
- Platforms that allow script tags
- Maximum customization and features

#### Method 2: Restricted Embed Code (iFrame)

This variant uses an iFrame – ideal for environments without native script support.

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://[YOUR-PODCAST-SLUG].podigee.io/embed?context=external"
  width="100%"
  height="400"
  frameborder="0"
  scrolling="no">
</iframe>
```

**Example:**
```html
<iframe 
  src="https://beatsquares-test-podcast.podigee.io/embed?context=external"
  width="100%"
  height="400"
  frameborder="0"
  scrolling="no">
</iframe>
```

**Best for:**
- Content management systems (CMS)
- Static site generators
- Platforms that restrict script tags
- Simple, quick implementation
- Environments with strict security policies

### Customization Options

#### Adjusting iFrame Size

Modify the dimensions to fit your layout:

**Standard Player:**
```html
<iframe 
  src="https://[YOUR-PODCAST-SLUG].podigee.io/embed?context=external"
  width="100%"
  height="400"
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

**Taller Player (More Episodes Visible):**
```html
<iframe 
  src="https://[YOUR-PODCAST-SLUG].podigee.io/embed?context=external"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

**Fixed Width:**
```html
<iframe 
  src="https://[YOUR-PODCAST-SLUG].podigee.io/embed?context=external"
  width="800"
  height="400"
  frameborder="0"
  style="max-width: 100%;">
</iframe>
```

#### URL Parameters

Customize the player behavior using URL parameters:

**Auto-play specific episode:**
```
?episode=5&autoplay=true
```

**Start with specific theme:**
```
?theme=dark
```

**Hide certain elements:**
```
?hideSubscribeButton=true
```

**Example with parameters:**
```html
<iframe 
  src="https://beatsquares-test-podcast.podigee.io/embed?context=external&theme=dark&episode=1"
  width="100%"
  height="400"
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Player Not Displaying

**Issue**: The embed code doesn't show anything on your page.

**Solutions**:
- Verify the iframe code is complete and properly formatted
- Check that your CMS or platform allows iframe embeds
- Ensure the podcast is published (not in draft mode)
- Verify the podcast ID in the URL is correct
- Clear your browser cache and reload the page
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)

### Player Shows But Won't Play

**Issue**: Player appears but audio doesn't start.

**Solutions**:
- Confirm the podcast audio file was generated successfully in BeatSquares
- Check that your browser allows audio playback
- Ensure your website uses HTTPS (mixed content warnings may block playback)
- Test in an incognito/private window to rule out extensions
- Try a different browser

### Sizing Issues

**Issue**: Player appears too large, too small, or overlaps other content.

**Solutions**:

For BeatSquares Episode Widget:
- Keep the height at `226px` for proper display
- Use `width="100%"` for responsive layouts
- Use fixed pixel width (`600px`) for specific designs

For Podigee Player:
- Standard height is around 400px, adjust based on content
- Use `width="100%"` for responsive layouts
- Test on mobile devices to ensure responsiveness
- Add CSS to the parent container for better control

### Content Security Policy (CSP) Errors

**Issue**: Browser console shows CSP violations.

**Solutions**:
- Add `https://app.beatsquares.com` to your CSP `frame-src` directive
- Add `https://*.podigee.io` and `https://player.podigee-cdn.net` if using Podigee integration
- Update your CSP header or meta tag:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" 
      content="frame-src 'self' https://app.beatsquares.com https://*.podigee.io; script-src 'self' https://player.podigee-cdn.net;">
```

### Podigee Player Not Updating

**Issue**: New episodes don't appear in the Podigee widget.

**Solutions**:
- Check that your BeatSquares-Podigee integration is still active
- Verify the episode is published (not in draft)
- Wait up to 24 hours for feed updates to propagate
- Manually trigger a feed refresh in Podigee dashboard
- Check Podigee status page for platform issues
- Clear your browser cache to see latest updates

### Mobile Display Issues

**Issue**: Player doesn't work well on mobile devices.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure the parent container is responsive
- Test with Chrome DevTools mobile emulator
- For BeatSquares widget, always use `width="100%"`
- For Podcaster.de, the min-width of 275px should work on most phones
- Consider hiding large players on mobile and showing a simpler version

## Best Practices

### Placement
- Place episode widgets near related content or episode descriptions
- Put multi-episode players on dedicated podcast pages
- Avoid placing multiple players too close together
- Consider user scroll behavior when positioning

### Performance
- Don't embed more than 3-4 single-episode players on one page
- Use Podigee multi-episode player instead of multiple single-episode embeds
- Consider lazy loading for players below the fold
- Monitor page load times after adding embeds
- Use the iFrame method for better page load performance in most cases

### User Experience
- Add descriptive text before the player (episode title, description, duration)
- Explain what the player is if it's not obvious from context
- Don't enable autoplay (disrupts user experience)
- Ensure sufficient contrast for readability

### SEO
- Add episode transcripts or show notes near the player
- Use semantic HTML headings to structure your content
- Include relevant keywords in surrounding text
- Add schema markup for podcasts (PodcastEpisode, PodcastSeries)

### Accessibility

- Ensure keyboard navigation works (Tab through controls)
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Add descriptive text explaining the audio content

### Privacy & Legal
- Update your privacy policy to mention embedded players
- Inform users about any analytics or cookies from embeds
- Comply with GDPR if serving European users
- Consider cookie consent for third-party embeds (Podigee)
- Review Podigee's privacy policy and data handling practices

## Advanced Techniques

### Dynamic Episode Loading

Use JavaScript to dynamically change which episode is displayed:

```html
<div id="podcast-player-container">
  <iframe
    id="podcast-player"
    src="https://app.beatsquares.com/podcasts/episode-1-id/stream/full"
    width="100%"
    height="226px"
    frameBorder="0"
    allowFullScreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

<script>
function loadEpisode(episodeId) {
  const player = document.getElementById('podcast-player');
  player.src = `https://app.beatsquares.com/podcasts/${episodeId}/stream/full`;
}
</script>

<button onclick="loadEpisode('episode-2-id')">Load Episode 2</button>
```

### Styling the Player Container

Add visual enhancements around your embedded player:

```html
<div class="podcast-card">
  <div class="podcast-header">
    <h3>Latest Episode: Building Your First Square</h3>
    <p class="episode-date">Published: October 20, 2025</p>
  </div>
  
  <iframe
    src="https://app.beatsquares.com/podcasts/[YOUR-PODCAST-ID]/stream/full"
    width="100%"
    height="226px"
    frameBorder="0"
    allowFullScreen>
  </iframe>
  
  <div class="podcast-footer">
    <p>Learn how to create your first BeatSquares Square in this 15-minute episode.</p>
    <a href="/podcast/full-episode" class="read-more">Full Show Notes →</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.podcast-card {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 2rem auto;
  background: white;
  border-radius: 12px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  overflow: hidden;
}

.podcast-header {
  padding: 1.5rem;
  background: #f8f8f8;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
}

.podcast-header h3 {
  margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;
  font-size: 1.25rem;
}

.episode-date {
  margin: 0;
  color: #666;
  font-size: 0.875rem;
}

.podcast-footer {
  padding: 1.5rem;
  background: #fafafa;
}

.read-more {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-top: 1rem;
  color: #000;
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: 600;
}

.read-more:hover {

}
```
