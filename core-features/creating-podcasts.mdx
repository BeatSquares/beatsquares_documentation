Creating a podcast in BeatSquares follows a structured workflow that transforms your written content into audio episodes. You'll start by working within a Square configured for podcast output, where you'll assemble your episode by organizing articles into segments—think of these as the building blocks of your podcast. Each segment can pull from one or more articles, giving you flexibility in how you structure your content.

The process moves through three main phases: first, you'll select and arrange your content segments; then BeatSquares generates a script that you can review and edit; and finally, the system creates the audio file. 

Throughout this workflow, you maintain control—you can reorder segments, add custom prompts to guide the AI's interpretation, and refine the generated script before committing to audio production. Once complete, you can either stream your podcast directly in BeatSquares or download it for distribution on external platforms.

The entire process typically takes just 10-15 minutes of active work, with the system handling the heavy lifting of script generation and audio production in the background while you focus on other tasks.

## Creating Podcasts

### Start from the Dashboard

Podcasts are created within Squares set to the output format **“Podcast.”**  

If you don’t have a Square yet, [learn how to create one here](/core-features/creating-squares).

### Step 1. Open a Square
If you already have a Square set to “Podcast,” click **View square** to begin.

You can add, remove, or reorder segments.

### Step 5. Select articles
Click **Add articles**. A popup lets you choose articles for each segment.

- To use articles from outside, check **Search for articles outside this square**.
