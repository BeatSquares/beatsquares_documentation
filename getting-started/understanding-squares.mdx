## Overview

A square is where BeatSquares' content transformation comes to life. Metaphorically speaking, a square serves as a gathering point for a specific target audience. Here, they can access all the content they're interested in, presented exactly in the format they prefer to consume it.

From a producers' standpoint, a Square serves as organizational unit that groups content according to different categories and helps manage the different outputs that have been generated based on it. Understanding how Squares work is essential for effectively using all other Beatsquares features.

## Prerequisites

- Completed account setup and dashboard familiarity
- Basic understanding of your content organization needs
- Access to create new content

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: What Are Squares

Learn the concept and purpose of Squares in your workflow.

1. Think of a square as a subset of all of the content your organization has to offer. It can include articles, events and press releases. It includes content that fits a certain definition, creating a basis for formats that fulfil a specific target groups' need.
2. Each Square produces many outputs, but they share the same output type. At the moment these are either WhatsApp-Channels, Podcasts or Newsletters.

For example, a square could look as follows:
All content that is of type: "article", that was released in the last 30 days, that covers the location: "Munich" and that should be transformed to output type: "podcast".

**Expected Result:** You understand the conceptual role of Squares in content organization.

### Step 2: Square Components

Understand what elements make up a Square.

1. Square name: This is the visible name of the square
2. Categories: Filters that let you chose which content should be included in the square
3. Output format: The output you wish to produce from the content inside of the square

### Step 3: Square Relationships

Learn how Squares relate to other content types.

1. Squares can contain multiple content pieces
2. Content can be associated with specific Squares, but is not uniquely available to a Square.

**Expected Result:** You understand how Squares integrate with your content creation workflow.
