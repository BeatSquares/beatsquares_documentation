The BeatSquares dashboard is your starting point for all content creation. It serves as a simple control panel where you can see all your Squares at a glance and quickly jump into any project.

Each Square appears as a card showing three key pieces of information: its name, selected categories, and output format (podcast, newsletter, WhatsApp message, etc.). This layout lets you instantly identify what type of content each Square produces and what topics it covers. From here, you can either click into an existing Square to create new content or start fresh by creating a new Square for a different content stream.

The dashboard keeps things intentionally simpleâ€”it's designed to get you into your content creation workflow as quickly as possible. Think of it as your launchpad: see what you have, decide where you want to work, and jump straight in.
